## Overview

I build this product page to practice my newely acquired knowledge of Redux toolkit and styled components.

### Website Navigation

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it

### Link

- Live Site URL: [https://sneakers-product-page.netlify.app](https://sneakers-product-page.netlify.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
- JavaScript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
- [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)

### What I learned

- Learned Redux and applied it heavily in the page.
- Learned Styled components and did not use any extra css files or css libraries.
- I'm building websites faster and faster the more I practice. üòÅ
